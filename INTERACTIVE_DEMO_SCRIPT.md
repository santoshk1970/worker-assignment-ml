const predictedWorker = predictions[0];
```
**After Slide:** **Proceed** to next slide
**Say:** *"This is the actual machine learning happening - KNN distance calculations, not database queries."*

---

### **Slide 11: Production Benefits**

```
**After Slide:** **Answer questions**, use live demos as needed
**Say:** *"Let me answer those questions with live demonstrations..."*

---

## üéØ Question-Specific Demo Responses

### **"How is this different from a database lookup?"**
**Demo Action:**
```bash
npm start  # Show different predictions again
```
**Say:** *"Database lookup would return the same result every time. Our ML gives different predictions based on job characteristics."*

### **"What if we don't have much historical data?"**
**Demo Action:**
```bash
# Show data generation with fewer records
npm run generate-data  # Then modify to show with less data
```
**Say:** *"The system gracefully handles small datasets, but predictions improve with more data - that's the learning aspect."*

### **"How do we handle new workers or machines?"**
**Demo Action:** Open `src/WorkerAssignmentML.js` and show the training method
**Say:** *"New workers can be added to the training data, and the model retrains automatically. This is the 'learning' in machine learning."*

### **"What about bias in the training data?"**
**Demo Action:**
```bash
npm run view-data  # Show data distribution
```
**Say:** *"Great question! The debug mode helps identify bias by showing which historical cases influenced each prediction."*

### **"How do we measure the system's effectiveness?"**
**Demo Action:** Show the confidence scores and worker statistics
**Say:** *"The system provides confidence scores, and in production, we'd track actual vs predicted performance for continuous improvement."*

---

### **Slide 16: Resources & Next Steps**
**Before Slide:** Prepare to share resources
**Action:** Show the actual GitHub repository structure
**After Slide:** **End presentation** with contact information
